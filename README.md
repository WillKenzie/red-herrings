# Knoxx Red Herrings
Red herrings designed to make it clear sudo exists, but the user can never run it. Useful if you want to disable sudo access universally.

These are designed for Knoxx, however, they are useful for any system and will work on any Linux system.

I am not responsible if you decide to prank your friend with a fake sudo and cause damage to their system or they cause damage to you.
